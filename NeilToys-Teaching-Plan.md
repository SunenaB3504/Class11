# 2. Types of Transactions

### What is a Transaction?
A transaction is any business activity or event that has a financial impact on the company and is recorded in the books of accounts. Transactions can involve the exchange of money, goods, or services, and may be internal (within the business) or external (with other parties).


**Steps in Posting:**
- Identify the account affected by each transaction in the book of original entry.
- Enter the amount on the correct side (debit or credit) of the relevant ledger account.
- Reference the source book and date for each entry in the ledger.
- Repeat for all transactions, ensuring every item is posted to its respective account.

Posting helps in:
- Classifying transactions by account type (e.g., cash, sales, rent, etc.).
- Preparing the trial balance and final accounts.
- Detecting errors and omissions in recording.

**Importance of Recording Transactions:**
- Provides a complete and accurate record of all business activities.
- Helps in tracking cash flow, outstanding dues, and financial position.
- Forms the basis for preparing financial statements and reports.
- Ensures compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

These tables show how transactions are posted from the books of original entry to the respective books. Each entry is classified and recorded according to its nature, making it easier to summarize and analyze financial data.

## 6. Balancing

Balancing in accounting ensures that the totals on both sides of a book or account are equal, and helps determine the closing balance for the next period. There are two main types:

### 1. Balancing the Cash Book
The cash book records all cash and bank transactions. To balance:
- Add up the total of receipts (debit side) and payments (credit side) for the period.
- Subtract the total payments from total receipts to find the closing balance (cash in hand or at bank).
- The closing balance is carried forward to the next period as the opening balance.
- The cash book is always balanced at the end of the period, and the totals of both sides are made equal by entering the closing balance.

### 2. Balancing Ledger Accounts
Ledger accounts are maintained for each item (e.g., sales, purchases, rent, salary, etc.). To balance:
- Add up the debit and credit sides of each account.
- Find the difference between the two sides; this is the closing balance.
- Enter the closing balance on the side with the lesser total to make both sides equal.
- The closing balance is then carried forward to the next accounting period.
- Balancing helps in preparing the trial balance and final accounts.

Both types of balancing are essential for accurate financial reporting and for ensuring that all transactions have been properly recorded and accounted for.

## 7. App Workflow
- User selects a transaction and chooses the correct book.
- App guides step-by-step filling of each book.
- Mistakes are identified with explanations and alternate suggestions.
- Follows the exact order of steps as in the textbook.
- User corrects entries and sees the final output (balanced books and accounts).

## 8. Step-by-Step Flow (as per book)
- Start with recording transactions in the correct book.
- Post entries to the ledger.
- Balance the books.
- Review and correct mistakes.

## 9. Final Output
- All books and accounts are correctly filled and balanced.
- User understands the flow and logic of business accounting.
