## 5. Balancing

Balancing in accounting ensures that the totals on both sides of a book or account are equal, and helps determine the closing balance for the next period. There are two main types:

### 1. Balancing the Cash Book
The cash book records all cash and bank transactions. To balance:
- Add up the total of receipts (debit side) and payments (credit side) for the period.
- Subtract the total payments from total receipts to find the closing balance (cash in hand or at bank).
- The closing balance is carried forward to the next period as the opening balance.
- The cash book is always balanced at the end of the period, and the totals of both sides are made equal by entering the closing balance.

### 2. Balancing Ledger Accounts
Ledger accounts are maintained for each item (e.g., sales, purchases, rent, salary, etc.). To balance:
- Add up the debit and credit sides of each account.
- Find the difference between the two sides; this is the closing balance.
- Enter the closing balance on the side with the lesser total to make both sides equal.
- The closing balance is then carried forward to the next accounting period.
- Balancing helps in preparing the trial balance and final accounts.

Both types of balancing are essential for accurate financial reporting and for ensuring that all transactions have been properly recorded and accounted for.

## 6. App Workflow
- User selects a transaction and chooses the correct book.
