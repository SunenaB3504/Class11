## 4. Accounting Equation (Definitions & Examples)

### Definition (from the book)
The accounting equation is a statement of equality between assets and the sum of liabilities and capital. It shows that:

**Assets = Liabilities + Capital**

This equation always stays balanced after every transaction. It is also called the Balance Sheet Equation.

### Explanation of Each Item

#### Asset
- **Definition:** Economic resources owned by the business that can be measured in money.
- **Example:** Cash, furniture, inventory, machinery.
- **Book Example:** If a business has ₹5,000 cash and ₹2,000 furniture, total assets = ₹7,000.

#### Liability
- **Definition:** Amounts the business owes to outsiders (creditors, loans, unpaid bills).
- **Example:** Bank loan, money owed to suppliers.
- **Book Example:** If a business owes ₹2,000 to a supplier, liability = ₹2,000.

#### Capital
- **Definition:** Owner’s investment in the business; also called owner’s equity.
- **Example:** Money the owner puts in to start the business.
- **Book Example:** If the owner invests ₹5,000, capital = ₹5,000.

### Example of Accounting Equation in Action

#### Example 1: Owner Starts Business
- Owner invests ₹5,000 cash.
- Assets = ₹5,000 (cash)
- Liabilities = ₹0
- Capital = ₹5,000
- **Equation:** ₹5,000 = ₹0 + ₹5,000

#### Example 2: Buy Furniture for Cash
- Buy furniture for ₹2,000 cash.
- Assets: Cash decreases by ₹2,000, Furniture increases by ₹2,000
- Liabilities = ₹0
- Capital = ₹5,000
- **Equation:** ₹3,000 (cash) + ₹2,000 (furniture) = ₹0 + ₹5,000
- **Total Assets:** ₹5,000

#### Example 3: Buy Goods on Credit
- Buy goods for ₹1,000 on credit.
- Assets: Goods increase by ₹1,000
- Liabilities: Creditors increase by ₹1,000
- Capital = ₹5,000
- **Equation:** ₹3,000 (cash) + ₹2,000 (furniture) + ₹1,000 (goods) = ₹1,000 (liabilities) + ₹5,000
- **Total Assets:** ₹6,000; Liabilities + Capital: ₹1,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹6,000

#### Example 4: Sell Goods for Cash
- Sell goods costing ₹500 for ₹700 cash.
- Assets: Cash increases by ₹700, Goods decrease by ₹500
- Liabilities = ₹1,000
- Capital increases by profit (₹200)
- **Equation:** ₹3,700 (cash) + ₹2,000 (furniture) + ₹500 (goods) = ₹1,000 (liabilities) + ₹5,200 (capital)
- **Total Assets:** ₹6,200; Liabilities + Capital: ₹1,000 + ₹5,200 = ₹6,200

## 5. Using Debit and Credit (Definitions & Examples)

### Definition (from the book)
