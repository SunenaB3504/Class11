## 4. Accounting Equation (Definitions & Examples)

### Definition (from the book)
The accounting equation is a statement of equality between assets and the sum of liabilities and capital. It shows that:

**Assets = Liabilities + Capital**

This equation always stays balanced after every transaction. It is also called the Balance Sheet Equation.

### Explanation of Each Item

#### Asset
- **Definition:** Economic resources owned by the business that can be measured in money.
- **Example:** Cash, furniture, inventory, machinery.
- **Book Example:** If a business has ₹5,000 cash and ₹2,000 furniture, total assets = ₹7,000.

#### Liability
- **Definition:** Amounts the business owes to outsiders (creditors, loans, unpaid bills).
- **Example:** Bank loan, money owed to suppliers.
- **Book Example:** If a business owes ₹2,000 to a supplier, liability = ₹2,000.

#### Capital
- **Definition:** Owner’s investment in the business; also called owner’s equity.
- **Example:** Money the owner puts in to start the business.
- **Book Example:** If the owner invests ₹5,000, capital = ₹5,000.

### Example of Accounting Equation in Action

#### Example 1: Owner Starts Business
- Owner invests ₹5,000 cash.
- Assets = ₹5,000 (cash)
- Liabilities = ₹0
- Capital = ₹5,000
- **Equation:** ₹5,000 = ₹0 + ₹5,000

#### Example 2: Buy Furniture for Cash
- Buy furniture for ₹2,000 cash.
- Assets: Cash decreases by ₹2,000, Furniture increases by ₹2,000
- Liabilities = ₹0
- Capital = ₹5,000
- **Equation:** ₹3,000 (cash) + ₹2,000 (furniture) = ₹0 + ₹5,000
- **Total Assets:** ₹5,000

#### Example 3: Buy Goods on Credit
- Buy goods for ₹1,000 on credit.
- Assets: Goods increase by ₹1,000
- Liabilities: Creditors increase by ₹1,000
- Capital = ₹5,000
- **Equation:** ₹3,000 (cash) + ₹2,000 (furniture) + ₹1,000 (goods) = ₹1,000 (liabilities) + ₹5,000
- **Total Assets:** ₹6,000; Liabilities + Capital: ₹1,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹6,000

#### Example 4: Sell Goods for Cash
- Sell goods costing ₹500 for ₹700 cash.
- Assets: Cash increases by ₹700, Goods decrease by ₹500
- Liabilities = ₹1,000
- Capital increases by profit (₹200)
- **Equation:** ₹3,700 (cash) + ₹2,000 (furniture) + ₹500 (goods) = ₹1,000 (liabilities) + ₹5,200 (capital)
- **Total Assets:** ₹6,200; Liabilities + Capital: ₹1,000 + ₹5,200 = ₹6,200

## 5. Using Debit and Credit (Definitions & Examples)

## 10. Classification of Ledger Accounts
- **Permanent Accounts:** Assets, liabilities, capital (carried forward).
- **Temporary Accounts:** Revenues, expenses, gains, losses (closed at period end).

**Permanent Accounts (Carried Forward):**
- These are accounts whose balances are carried forward to the next accounting period. They include assets, liabilities, and capital accounts. The balances remain open and continue into future periods.
- **Example:** The balance in the Cash Account at the end of the year is carried forward and becomes the opening balance for the next year.

**Temporary Accounts (Ending at the Period):**
- These are accounts that are closed at the end of the accounting period. They include revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. Their balances are transferred to the capital account (or profit and loss account) and do not carry forward.
- **Example:** The balance in the Sales Account is transferred to the Profit & Loss Account at year-end, and the account starts with zero balance in the next period.

## What is an Asset, Liability, Capital, Debit, and Credit?

### Asset
- Things a business owns (cash, furniture, goods, machines).
- **Example:** If you have ₹500 in your wallet, that is your asset.

### Liability
- Money a business owes to others (loans, unpaid bills).
- **Example:** If you borrow ₹200 from a friend, that is your liability.

### Capital
- Money the owner puts into the business. Also called owner’s equity.
- **Example:** If you start a business with ₹1,000 from your savings, that is your capital.

### Debit (Dr.)
- Left side of an account. Shows things coming in or increasing (like getting cash or buying furniture).
- **Example:** Buying a chair for ₹100, you debit the Furniture Account.

### Credit (Cr.)
- Right side of an account. Shows things going out or decreasing (like paying cash or selling goods).
- **Example:** Paying ₹100 cash for the chair, you credit the Cash Account.
